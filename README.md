## TO-DO App

A small GUI daily goal management app prototyped to help people with ADHD. 

It is based on the Pomodoro technique, where you can set goals with a number of session required to complete said goal. Then each session has a work timer and a rest timer that go off automatically when the goal timer is started.

Once the task is done it is possible to see all the compelted goals in the archive.

Right now this is a prototype and the time scale has been sped up to help with debugging.

Building the app is really easy: `go run .` or `go build .` to respectively run or build the project, that's all!
